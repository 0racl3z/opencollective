This repo describes the high level view of the OpenCollective project. This is where we will discuss broad topics such as general documentation, FAQ, new features and how to contribute to the project.

## Why OpenCollective?

While there are plenty of tools to help you start a meetup, an open source project, or a movement, there is no easy way to collect money as a group to sustain and develop your activities. We want to change that. We want to enable communities to have economic power so that they can have a larger impact in the world.

The goal of OpenCollective is to create a [New Form of Association for the Internet](https://medium.com/open-collective/a-new-form-of-association-for-the-internet-generation-part-1-6d6c4f5dd27f#.fgb60dorq) to enable those communities to collect and disburse money transparently.

We want to achieve this by giving existing organizations all around the world the tools to host open collectives under their umbrella. Those host organizations are the heroes that empower people in their community to create associations without friction.

## Why Open Source?

Regulations are different all over the world. Governements are local operating systems with their own set of APIs. We need to build a browser that will offer a new global and unique interface on top of which we can start developing new communities that won't have to worry about the complexity of the underlying operating system.

To achieve that, we will have to adapt the software to comply with local regulations. While the concept of umbrella organization is a universal concept, the way bookkeeping and tax reporting should be performed varies between countries. Payment processing is also another area that needs to be adapted locally to make sure that most people online and offline can contribute to a collective.

## Why not using the Blockchain?

We would definitely love to explore how we can use the blockchain to achieve our goal. But in the meantime, we can already go a long way by using existing technologies and services (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) that are already well established. We don't want to wait for self-driving cars to be around before starting building Uber.
