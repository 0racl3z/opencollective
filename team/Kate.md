Bio
---

I'm an American expat from Alabama living in London since 2010. 
I learned to code at the non-profit bootcamp [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com) in summer 2018, and went on to work at the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/) before joining Open Collective.
In my free time I love to do yoga, inline skating, art, and spend time tending to my many house plants. I also have two beautiful guinea pigs named Mopsa and Phoebe.

Schedule
--------

Based in London, I'm in the [GMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time)/[BST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time) timezone.

I usually start my day between 9h - 11h (often depending on good weather and if I've gone for a morning skate!) and finish between 17h and 20h (depending usually on if I have taken a longer midday break).

The fastest way to reach me is through [Open Collective's Slack](https://slack.opencollective.com/).
