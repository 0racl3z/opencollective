Bio
---

I'm a French developer approching 30 years old. I grew up in south of France, and came back to live there recently.
I studied at Epitech in Marseille, and made 1 year at CSU Long Beach (USA).

My favorite sport is hikking/trekking, and I like to play some music (guitare, saxophone) when I find the time!

Schedule
--------

Based in Aix-en-Provence, I'm in the [CET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time) timezone.

I usualy start my day between 8h and 9h and finish between 16h30 and 18h (depending of the workload and whether I took a real pause at noon).

The fastest way to reach me is through [Open Collective's Slack](https://slack.opencollective.com/) (I use my real name there),
email is also fine for non-emergencies.

Open Source
-----------

I created and still maintain [CaptainFact](https://github.com/CaptainFact), an open-source (AGPL3) set of tools for collaborative and real-time fact-checking.

I also maintain a few small libraries for Elixir, a language I really enjoy:
- [Burnex](https://github.com/Betree/burnex), a burner email (temporary address) detector 
- [Atomex](https://github.com/Betree/atomex), an RSS/ATOM feed builder with a focus on standards compliance, security and extensibility
