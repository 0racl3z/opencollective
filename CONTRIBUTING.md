# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to OpenCollective! It's people like you that make OpenCollective such a great community.
OpenCollective is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you!

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with 
- **QA**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. screenshots with the console open)
- **Documentation**: suggest edits to [our wiki](https://github.com/OpenCollective/OpenCollective/wiki)
- **Marketing**: writing blog posts, use cases, sharing success stories. 
- **Internationalization**: [translating the interface](https://github.com/OpenCollective/OpenCollective/wiki/Strings)
- **Design**: many collectives don't have a logo or a background image for their hero. Create an issue for it and submit your proposal. We always give credit where credit is due.
- **Code**: there are plenty of [open issues](https://github.com/OpenCollective/OpenCollective/issues). Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.
